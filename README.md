# Python code for *Quantitative Social Science: An Introduction*

Welcome! This repository contains Python companion guides for Kosuke Imai's [Quantitative Social Science](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691175461/quantitative-social-science) (QSS). 

The repository is modeled after the [QSS GitHub repository](https://github.com/kosukeimai/qss), which contains base R and tidyverse code for the original and [tidyverse](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691222271/quantitative-social-science) editions of QSS, along with the datasets that are analyzed in book. 

The python scripts are available in the following file formats: .py, .ipynb, and .pdf.
